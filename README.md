# DICE DASH
Welcome to Dice Dash. This is a simple dice game where players roll two dice and aim to reach a total score of 100 points. But beware of rolling ones, as they can wipe out your score!

## How to play?
Objective: The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach or exceed a total score of 100 points.

Setup: Each player begins with a total score of 0. Players take turns rolling two dice.

Gameplay: Players roll two dice on their turn and add the numbers together.
If a player rolls a double (excluding ones), they gain a bonus of 5 points in addition to the sum of the numbers rolled.
If a player rolls a one on either die, they lose their current score and their turn ends.
If a player rolls two ones, they lose their entire total score and their turn ends.
Players must decide whether to "hold" and keep their current score or continue rolling to potentially increase their score.

Hold Rule: When a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

Winning the game: The game concludes when one player reaches or exceeds a total score of 100 points. The player with the highest score at the end of a round is declared the winner.
