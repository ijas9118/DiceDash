        <b>Objective:</b> The goal of the game is to be the first player to
        reach or exceed a total score of 100 points. <br /><br />
        <b>Setup:</b> Each player begins with a total score of 0. Players take
        turns rolling two dice. <br /><br />
        <b>Gameplay:</b> Players roll two dice on their turn and add the numbers
        together. <br />If a player rolls a double (excluding ones), they gain a
        bonus of 5 points in addition to the sum of the numbers rolled. <br />
        If a player rolls a one on either die, they lose their current score and
        their turn ends. <br />
        If a player rolls two ones, they lose their entire total score and their
        turn ends. <br />
        Players must decide whether to "hold" and keep their current score or
        continue rolling to potentially increase their score. <br /><br /><b
          >Hold Rule:</b
        >
        When a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their
        total score, and it becomes the next player's turn. <br /><br />
        <b>Winning the game: </b> The game concludes when one player reaches or
        exceeds a total score of 100 points. The player with the highest score
        at the end of a round is declared the winner.
